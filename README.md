# React Hooks Testing Project 🚀

## Overview 📖
This project is a collection of tests and examples designed to explore and demonstrate the usage of various React Hooks introduced in React 16.8. The goal is to provide a hands-on understanding of how each hook works through practical implementations. This is a learning-focused project, primarily for educational purposes, and serves as a reference for developers looking to revise or understand React Hooks.

## Hooks Covered 🔧
The project includes examples and tests for the following React Hooks:

- **useState()** 🗳️: Manages state in functional components.
- **useEffect()** ⏳: Handles side effects, such as data fetching or subscriptions.
- **useRef()** 📍: Provides a mutable reference to DOM elements or values that persist across renders.
- **useMemo()** ⚡: Optimizes performance by memoizing expensive computations.
- **useCallback()** 🔄: Memoizes callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **useContext()** 🌐: Accesses context values to share data across the component tree.
- **useReducer()** 🛠️: Manages complex state logic with a reducer function.
- **useMyHook()** ✨: A custom hook created to demonstrate how to build reusable logic in React.

## Project Structure 📁
- `src/` 🗂️:
  - `components/` 🧩: Individual components testing each hook.
  - `hooks/` 🔩: Custom hook implementations (e.g., `useMyHook`).
- `tests/` ✅: Unit tests for hook functionality (if applicable).
- `README.md` 📝: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Purpose 🎯
This project was developed as a personal exercise to:
- Deepen understanding of React Hooks through practical examples 🧠.
- Test edge cases and common use cases for each hook 🧪.
- Create a reusable reference for learning and revision 📚.

## Getting Started 🏁
To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository 📥:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory 📂:
   ```bash
