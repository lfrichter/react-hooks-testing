# React Hooks Testing Project

## Overview
This project is a collection of tests and examples designed to explore and demonstrate the usage of various React Hooks introduced in React 16.8. The goal is to provide a hands-on understanding of how each hook works through practical implementations. This is a learning-focused project, primarily for educational purposes, and serves as a reference for developers looking to revise or understand React Hooks.

## Hooks Covered
The project includes examples and tests for the following React Hooks:

- **useState()**: Manages state in functional components.
- **useEffect()**: Handles side effects, such as data fetching or subscriptions.
- **useRef()**: Provides a mutable reference to DOM elements or values that persist across renders.
- **useMemo()**: Optimizes performance by memoizing expensive computations.
- **useCallback()**: Memoizes callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **useContext()**: Accesses context values to share data across the component tree.
- **useReducer()**: Manages complex state logic with a reducer function.
- **useMyHook()**: A custom hook created to demonstrate how to build reusable logic in React.

## Project Structure
- `src/`:
  - `components/`: Individual components testing each hook.
  - `hooks/`: Custom hook implementations (e.g., `useMyHook`).
- `tests/`: Unit tests for hook functionality (if applicable).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Purpose
This project was developed as a personal exercise to:
- Deepen understanding of React Hooks through practical examples.
- Test edge cases and common use cases for each hook.
- Create a reusable reference for learning and revision.


## Notes
- This project is for testing and educational purposes. The code is experimental and may not follow production-level best practices.
- Each hook is demonstrated with simple, isolated examples to focus on its core functionality.
- Contributions or suggestions for improving the examples are welcome!
